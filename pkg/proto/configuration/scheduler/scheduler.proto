  // to sacrifice for increased worker utilization. Setting this

  //
  // To compute the eigenvector, a process called "power iteration" is
  // used, in which repeated matrix multiplications are performed. This
  // method approximates the eigenvector, each iteration giving more
  // accurate results. This option can be used to control how many
  // iterations should be performed. Matrix multiplication will be

  //   contributes to convergence.
  // - Probabilities of previous executions of the same action are
  //   cached in the Initial Size Class Cache (ISCC), meaning that
  //   the algorithm often has a good starting point.
