  //
  // Tools such as /usr/bin/cc, /usr/bin/ld, etc. that ship with macOS
  // are stubs that forward their calls to copies that are part of
  // Xcode. As it is possible to install multiple versions of Xcode at
  // different locations on the file system, these stubs will use the
  // DEVELOPER_DIR and SDKROOT environment variables to determine which
  // copy of Xcode to use.
  //
  // Because the location at which Xcode is installed may differ between
  // local and remote execution environments, Bazel does not set the
  // DEVELOPER_DIR and SDKROOT environment variables directly. Instead,
  // it sets environment variables APPLE_SDK_PLATFORM,
  // APPLE_SDK_VERSION_OVERRIDE and XCODE_VERSION_OVERRIDE. The remote
  // worker is responsible for interpreting these environment variables
  // and resolving those to the location of the intended copy of Xcode
  // and the desired SDK.
  //
  // This option can be used to specify how values of
  // XCODE_VERSION_OVERRIDE translate to values of DEVELOPER_DIR. The
  // value of SDKROOT is obtained by invoking the xcrun utility with
  // DEVELOPER_DIR set.
  //
  // Example:
  //
  //   {
  //     "12.5.1.12E507": "/Applications/Xcode12.app/Contents/Developer",
  //     "13.4.1.13F100": "/Applications/Xcode13.app/Contents/Developer",
