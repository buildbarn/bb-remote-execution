  // - The invocation to which the execution request belongs, so that
  //   may be scheduled fairly with respect to actions queued by other

  // - The execution timeout that needs to be applied.
  // - If the platform has workers partitioned across multiple size
  //   classes, it must choose a size class on which execution is
  //   attempted initially.
  //
  // The action router is the subsystem that is responsible for
  // extracting these properties.
  //
  // It is possible to write fairly complex action router configurations
  // (e.g., ones that apply different policies between platforms, or
  // reroute requests from one platform to another). However, for
  // typical setups the configuration can remain fairly simple. It is

  // Allow workers to continue to execute actions from the same
  // invocation up to given amount of time, if doing so keeps the number
  // of workers assigned to an invocation balanced. It is worth setting
  // this option if there is an inherent overhead when switching between
  // actions belonging to different invocations.
  //
  // For example, consider the case where workers are configured to run
  // tests inside virtual machines, and that the virtual machine's boot
  // image is provided as part of the input root. When actions that use
  // the same boot image run right after each other, the existing
  // virtual machine may be repurposed. If the boot image is different,
  // a costly restart needs to be performed, so that a new image may be
  // loaded. By placing actions that use different boot images in
  // separate invocations and adding stickiness, the probability of
  // needing to do virtual machine restarts decreases.
  //
  // Because invocations can be nested by using multiple invocation key
  // extractors, this field contains a list of durations of stickiness
  // to apply at each level. If the number of invocation keys of an
  // operation exceeds the configured number of stickiness limits, the
  // stickiness limit for the remaining invocation keys is assumed to be

  // There is a small probability that this implementation runs actions
  // on size classes even if it is fairly certain that they are
  // suboptimal (either too small or too large). This is necessary, as
  // without it there is a chance that previous execution statistics
  // stored in the ISCC remain permanently outdated. The downside of
  // this strategy is that it may cause unnecessary delays, especially
  // when attempted against long-running actions that are part of the
  // critical path of a build.
  //
  // To mitigate this, this implementation uses an alternative execution
  // strategy in case there is a >50% probability of failure on a
  // smaller size class. Instead of first executing the action on the
  // smaller size class, followed by falling back to the largest size
  // class, it schedules it the other way around. The client is
  // unblocked as soon as the execution on the largest size class
  // succeeds, while the execution on the smallest size class is
  // performed in the background.
  //
  // To make sure that operations that are merely created to perform
  // learning in the background don't starve other builds that are
  // taking place, all of them are placed in a single fictive
  // invocation, so that fairness is respected.
  //
  // This option determines the maximum number of background learning
  // operations that may be in the QUEUED execution stage, per size
  // class. Excessive operations are discarded. Not only is it necessary
  // to set this value to ensure that the scheduler doesn't run out of
  // memory due to background actions piling up, it can also put a limit
  // on how much the cluster is scaled up (in case autoscaling based on
  // queue sizes is performed).
