// Buildbarn's workers connect to the scheduler to receive instructions
// on what they should be doing. They can either be instructed to be
// idle or to execute a build action. They can also report their state
// to the scheduler. The purpose of reporting state is twofold:
//
// - Upon completion of a build action, the worker reports the outcome
//   of the build action, so that it may be communicated back to a
//   client.
// - It allows for centralized management/insight in the functioning of
//   the build cluster.
//
// All of this exchange of information takes place through a single type
// of RPC named Synchronize(), called by the worker against the
// scheduler. The worker provides information about its identity and its
// current state. The scheduler responds with instructions on whether to
// do something different or to continue.
//
// Every response contains a timestamp that instructs the worker when to
// resynchronize. Calls to Synchronize() are guaranteed to be
// non-blocking when it is executing a build action. They may be
// blocking in case the worker is idle or reporting the completion of a
// build action.  In that case the scheduler may decide to let the call
// hang until more work is available.
